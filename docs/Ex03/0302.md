# Task 02: Publish and test the declarative agent 

## Introduction
Stakeholders need proof that Copilot can write tasks automatically before wider rollout.

## Description
In this task you will publish the updated agent and validate its behaviour by issuing a test prompt that results in a new task being created in the user’s Tasks list in Microsoft To‑Do.

## Success criteria
 - Publishing completes successfully.
 - Prompting the agent creates a new task in the Tasks list.

## Key steps
