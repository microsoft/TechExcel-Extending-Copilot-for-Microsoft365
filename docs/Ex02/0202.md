## Task 02: Build and install the declarative agent in Copilot Studio 

## Introduction

To eliminate silos, Best For You Organics will surface project‑deadline knowledge directly in Copilot via a low‑code declarative agent.

## Description

In this task you will use Copilot Studio’s conversational designer to generate a declarative agent named **Project Tracker**, configure it to ingest the Project Deadlines SharePoint site as its grounding data source, and save the agent to the tenant.

## Success criteria

 - Project Tracker agent is listed in Copilot Studio.
 - The agent opens without errors and recognises the SharePoint site as a data source.

## Key steps

### 01: Start the agent wizard

1. Open a new browser tab and go to **www.copilotstudio.com** and sign in with your credentials. 

1. On the left pane, select **Agents**. 

1. Select **Copilot for Microsoft 365**.

1. In the **Agents** section, select **+ Add**.

    {: .note }
    > In the **Agents** section of Copilot Studio, you'll find options in the upper-right corner to configure your agent, allowing for flexibility based on your preference: 
    > 
    > **Conversational Configuration**:  
    > Select this option to leverage a guided, conversational experience. Here, you can simply describe what you'd like to create, and Copilot Studio will automatically populate the necessary fields and properties based on your input. 
    > 
    > **Skip to Configuration**:  
    > Choose this option to bypass the guided setup and jump directly to the configuration page, where you can manually enter all agent properties yourself.  
    > 
    > We'll use the conversational approach to handle deadlines for a project. 

1. Create an agent that can help track deadlines for a project by entering the following into the prompt: 

    ```Copilot-wrap-nocolor
    I want to create an agent that can help me track the software projects created by my company.
    ```

    {: .note }
    > Behind the scenes, Copilot Studio gathers all the necessary information to populate the agent's configuration automatically. With these details in place, the Copilot agent is now set up to efficiently track deadlines.  
    >
    > The tools to create and manage Copilot agents are evolving rapidly. The questions that are displayed and the order of questions may differ from what you see in these instructions.

1. Copilot asks you to confirm whether the name of you Agent should be Project Tracker. Enter `Yes`.

1. Inform the Copilot of the tone you wish to use for responses. 

    ```Copilot-wrap-nocolor
    Please answer in a professional but simple way.
    ```

    {: .note }
    > Copilot Studio is now ingesting this information to fine-tune the instructions that the declarative agent will use behind the scenes. 

1. Configure the Copilot to restrict responses to software projects created by the company. 

1. Enter the following prompt: 

    ```Copilot-wrap-nocolor
    Please help only with questions related to the software projects created by my company. 
    ``` 

    {: .note }
    > You can ensure that the agent assists only with the specific topic we want to cover rather than responding to any general questions that might be asked. 

1. In the upper-right of the page, select **Create**.  

    {: .note }
    > The conversation is translated into the **Agent name**, **Description**, **Instructions**, and **Starter prompts**: 
    >
    > - Agent name: Name of the project 
    > - Description: Purpose of the project  >
    > - Instructions: Guidance that the declarative agent will follow when it needs to respond to the user
    > - Starter prompts: Suggested prompts that will be displayed to the user when it will open up the declarative agent 
    > - Knowledge: Data used to inform and improve AI-generated responses 
    
    {: .important }
    > In addition to configuration, there are two other essential operations that you can perform with a declarative agent: define its knowledge base and set up actions. 
    > 
    > Defining the knowledge base determines the types of data, files, and resources the Copilot can access to generate responses. By default, the agent uses only the model's internal knowledge.  
    > However, we can expand its scope by allowing access to external sources, such as SharePoint sites or Graph connector sources, enhancing its ability to provide relevant insights. 
    > 
    > For instance, if you have a SharePoint site containing a document with key deadlines for the Contoso project, then by granting the agent access to this site, you can ensure it can pull in these specific project deadlines when needed.

1. In the **Knowledge** section, select **+ Add knowledge**. 

    
    {: .important }
    > Take note of the available knowledge sources. Here, you can connect to SharePoint sites or other Graph connector sources for the declarative agent to generate responses. 
    >  
    > These sections also allow you to limit Copilot's knowledge to specific sources, ensuring it uses only the selected information rather than all available knowledge.  
    > 
    > Once configured, permissions for this agent can be set up to reuse any added knowledge sources for different topics as needed. 

1. Select **SharePoint**. 

    ![sharepoint1.jpg](../../media/sharepoint1.jpg) 

1. In the **Enter URL of the SharePoint site** filed, enter the URL of the SharePoint site you created at the beginning of this exercise (**@lab.Variable(URL)**) and then select **+ Add**.

    > 
    > The administrator will need to go to the Admin center and navigate to **Integrated Apps** and then approve the request to make the agent available to the organization.  
    > 
    > Unlike other sharing options, publishing an agent to the entire organization adds the agent to the internal catalog, making it available across the organization. 

    {: .note }
    > Shared apps can be found in **Teams**. In the left pane, go to **Apps** then select **Built for your org**. All declarative Copilots published to the organization will be found here.

You focused on the knowledge aspect, showing how questions can be answered based on specific data sources, rather than the entire Microsoft 365 dataset. 
    > 
You also reviewed publishing options and briefly introduced the Actions feature, which allows further customization of a declarative agent's capabilities.
