## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll learn to create a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot using a low-code approach. This process leverages Copilot Studio to streamline configuration and deployment, turning complex settings into manageable, reusable properties that enhance consistency and speed. 

As we proceed, you'll see how each element of your set-up-based on our previous discussions-translates seamlessly into the properties and configurations of a declarative agent. This approach provides a foundation for rapidly building and deploying agents without the need for extensive coding knowledge.
