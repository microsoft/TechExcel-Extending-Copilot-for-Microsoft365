# Task 01: Create a SharePoint site 

## Introduction
Project documents at Best For You Organics are scattered across personal drives, slowing decision‑making. A dedicated SharePoint site will centralise deadline‐related artifacts for Copilot to reason over.

## Description
In this task you will provision a SharePoint team site named Project Deadlines and upload three sample Word documents, creating a central library that the Copilot agent can later query for deadline information.

## Success criteria
 - Project Deadlines SharePoint team site is created.
 - TaskMaster Pro.docx, CodeFusion AI.docx and HealthSync 360.docx are uploaded to Documents.
