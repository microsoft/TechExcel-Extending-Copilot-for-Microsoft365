# Task 03: Build and install the declarative agent in Visual Studio Code 

## Introduction

After validating Project Tracker in Copilot Studio, Best For You Organics’s engineering team wants to maintain the agent as source‑controlled code and enrich it with custom conversation starters and data sources. Visual Studio Code with Teams Toolkit provides the scaffolding and manifest editing tools required to achieve this.

## Description

In this task you will create a brand‑new declarative agent project in Teams Toolkit, provision it to the tenant, and then edit the generated declarativeAgent.json manifest to add conversation starters, a SharePoint grounding site, and Web Search capability.

## Success criteria

 - A new Teams Toolkit project named sampleDeclarativeCopilot is successfully created and provisioned.
 - The declarativeAgent.json manifest includes a conversation_starters array with three entries.
 - A OneDriveAndSharePoint capability referencing your Project Deadlines SharePoint URL is added.
 - A WebSearch capability is appended and the manifest formats without errors.
