# Task 01: Create a connection to an enterprise website

## Introduction
Support engineers waste time switching to an external knowledge‑base site for DeviceManager Pro. Indexing it with a Graph connector will surface answers directly in Copilot.

## Description
In this task you will create an Enterprise Websites Cloud Graph connector connection that crawls the DeviceManagerPro knowledge‑base site, bringing its articles into Microsoft Search and Copilot for semantic grounding.

## Success criteria
 - DeviceManagerPro KB connector is published and shows Preparing to sync/Ready.
 - Connector description is saved for Copilot grounding.

## Key steps
