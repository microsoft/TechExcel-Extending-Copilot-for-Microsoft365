# Task 01: Prepare the environment 

## Introduction
Best For You Organics wants to index proprietary data sources that have no pre‑built connector. Building a custom Graph connector offers full control but requires a TypeScript toolchain.

## Description
In this task you will prepare the node‑based development environment by using npm to globally install the create‑graph‑connector scaffolding utility.

## Success criteria
 - PowerShell reports successful installation of create‑graph‑connector.

## Key steps

### 01: Install the scaffolding utility

1. On the Virtual Machine Windows taskbar, right-click **Start** (Windows icon), and select **Terminal (Admin)** to open a PowerShell session with Admin priviledges.

   {: .note }
   > Select **Yes** to allow the Terminal app to make changes to your device.

1. On the PowerShell prompt, to install the *create-graph-connector* package run the following command:

   ```
   npm i - create-graph-connector
   ```

   {: .note }
   > This command will install the package which contains tools that will be made available to the system.

1. Change to the **Graph_Connector** directory by enter the following:

    ```
    cd C:\Users\Admin\Graph_Connector 
    ``` 

1. To begin creating the project, run the following:

   ```
   npm create graph-connector
   ```

1. Select **y** to install any required packages. 

1. Complete the *create-graph-connector* project creation wizard by entering the following:
   
   | Item | Value |
   |:---------|:---------|
   | Project name:   | **sampleconnector**   |
   | Graph connector name:   | **Sample Connector**   |
   | Graph connector description:   | **Imports data from Best For You Organics app**   |
   | Connection ID (between 3 and 32 chars):   | **sampleconnector**   |
   | Template   | **TypeScript (basic)**   |

1. Change directory into the newly created project directory by entering the following:

   ```
   cd .\sampleconnector\
   ```

1. Now open Visual Studio Code (VSCode) using the command below, to view the basic building blocks of a Graph connector:

   ```

   > The project that gets created by the template creator is based on TypeScript. All of the code that supports the custom connector is built with TypeScript.
   > However, you are not constrained to using TypeScript when creating Graph connectors, you can use any technology that's able to perform HTTP calls.
   > Examples of other technologies can be reviewed here: [Graph-Connectors-Samples](https://github.com/pnp/graph-connectors-samples "Graph-Connectors-Samples") and more information on Graph connectors can be found here: [Connectors Gallery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftsearch/connectors-gallery "Connectors Gallery").
