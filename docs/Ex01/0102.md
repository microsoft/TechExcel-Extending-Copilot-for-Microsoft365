# Task 02: Install the *Prompt Coach* agent from the app catalog

## Introduction
Installing an agent is straightforward, similar to installing an application in Teams or Microsoft 365. Microsoft developed several agents to enhance customer experiences, including specialized *coaches* designed to improve performance in specific areas. Examples include the Idea Coach for brainstorming and the Learning Coach for upskilling technical skills. 

## Description
In this task you will locate the Prompt Coach listing in the catalog, review its capabilities and permissions, and then install the app so that it becomes an available Copilot agent for your tenant.

## Success criteria
 - Prompt Coach is installed and opens in focus mode.
 - The agent appears in the right‑hand Agents list.

## Key steps

    > In this mode, the Copilot UI is replaced with the agent's logo, name, and specific prompt starters that you can use. From this point, all interactions will be managed by the agent. For example, if you ask, *Help me generate a prompt to be used in Copilot* the agent will utilize its predefined instructions, knowledge, and actions to provide a tailored response.

1. The agent can be managed from the rightmost pane. Hover over the agent to reveal the pin and the ellipsis (...):

    - Pin: Allows you to pin the agent, making it readily accessible in the list of available agents.
    - Ellipsis (...): Provides options such as uninstalling the agent to remove it.
