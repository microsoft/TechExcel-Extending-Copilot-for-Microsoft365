# Exercise 01: Enhance Copilot experience with declarative agents


This exercise introduces how organizations can adopt agents to create customized versions of Microsoft 365 Copilot tailored to their needs. Examples include an HR agent for company policies and an IT agent for internal procedures, using official documents as data sources. 

The workshop demonstrates building agents with tools like Agent Builder, Copilot Studio, and the Teams Toolkit, while also highlighting a no-code approach for ease of use. 

Additionally, companies, including Microsoft, and its partners, provide agents, many of which may are already be available in the catalog, similar to Microsoft 365 and Teams applications.
